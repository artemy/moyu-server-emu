== Inspecting the firmware

[.column]
* Dump the firmware via UART with `esptool`
** Firmware wasn't protected or encrypted
* `Ghidra` supports ESP32 (Xtensa architecture)
** Built by the NSA
** Has disassembler, decompiler and even debugger

* Developed by the NSA
* Originally revealed in WikiLeaks
* Open-sourced in 2019
* Most likely existed for much longer (since at least 1999)
* Written in Java

== Disassembling the firmware

[.column.is-one-third]
* Locate the place where the credentials decoding happens
* Disassembled code is very convoluted
* ChatGPT helped to make sense of the part of it

code is still better than some human-written code that I've seen

== How the decoding works?

* The audio is captured in a circular buffer
* Data is filtered, normalized and chunked
* Main frequency is detected with FFT
* Compare the frequency against the table
* ????
* +++<s>+++PROFIT!!!+++</s>+++ Some checksum calculation? (ChatGPT was not sure)
* SSID and password are extracted
