** Manufacturer's website is down
* Not clear how to operate the device without the app

== The reconnaissance

* Let's see what we can find on the internet:
** Forum posts with complaints from at least early 2023
** Reviews on YouTube that show the device operation
** Android .apk available via (shady) archive websites, no iOS app

* Bunch of places that still sell it (for ~â‚¬40!)
* No similar projects

== Digging deeper

* YouTube reviews shed some light on the operation:
** The device doesn't work offline, it needs a Wi-Fi AP
** The Wi-Fi credentials are transmitted via sound (!)
** Once the device is online, you pair it with the app
** The app can modify device settings and display conversation logs

== Episode IV - A New Hope

* Maybe the .apk still works?
* App errors on startup
** The logs show server timeout
* It seems that the manufacturer's server is down for good

== The challenge

* The manufacturer's server is down
* The device is effectively a brick
* Can operate it again?
* I would need to understand how the server was supposed to work...
