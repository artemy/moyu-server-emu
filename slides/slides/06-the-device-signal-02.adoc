== Reconstructing the signal, attempt #2

* I found a frequency table in the firmware
* The spacing between frequencies is actually 187.5Hz
* Device recognized the sound reconstructed from the right frequencies!
* MFSK16 is confirmed?
* Still doesn't explain the encoding...

* I only had to play around with pulse length, it was 65ms
* At this point I switched to the other challenges

== Let's look at those samples again...

* All three samples have in common:
** Length of each sample (in pulses) is
+
[stem]
++++
L = (S + P + 3) * 2
++++
+
Where S is length of SSID and P is a length of password
+
** The first byte of encoded credentials matches actual:

|actual|6D|6F|79|75

* Why are the next bytes different?

[.columns]
== Doing some math

[.column.is-half]
* Randomly playing around with the first two bytes, I noticed:
+
[stem]
++++
A_2 = E_2 - E_1
++++
+
e.g., 0xdc-0x6d=0x6f
+
Where A - actual value, E are encoded bytes
+
* This was true for all three samples and for all the remaining bytes
* *{sp} substraction is done with an 8-bit integer wrapping; the bytes are unsigned

== What about the remaining three bytes?

[.column.is-one-third]
* From disassembly it's evident that one byte is a terminator/separator
* Two other bytes are some kind of checksum?
* ChatGPT mentioned something similar...

== Checkmate

[.column.is-one-third]
* Let's look at the "checksum" method again
* ChatGPT says it's CRC16-Modbus
* Calculating it manually worked!
* I can generate my own credentials!

Evidently, only the first byte of the checksum is checked I couldn't find any information on this funny encoding and ChatGPT could not explain either
