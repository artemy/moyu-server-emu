== The remaining challenge

* The device sends the recorded audio to the server via HTTP
* `Content-Type: audio/opus`
* No player could recognize this data

== Audio recording

* The firmware seems to contain code that closely matches open source `libopusenc` library
* Trying to decode audio using this library doesn't work
* Do I receive the data incorrectly?
* Maybe it is encrypted?

--
the device supports many formats, but by correlating the UART messages I could tell it was using opus

== Looking at the bytes (again)

[.column.is-one-third]
* There is certainly some pattern: chunks separated by zeroes?
* The first four bytes: length?
* The actual chunk length is always larger by four
* The decoder would not accept the chunks

== Garbage in - garbage out

* New approach: skipping first N bytes for each chunk
* It worked after I cut exactly eight bytes!
* The chunk format is almost clear now:
+
[%autowidth]
[cols="d,d,d,d,d,d,d,d,d,d,d,d"]
|===
|0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|...

|00|00|00|08|AA|BB|CC|DD|01|02|03|...
4+|length (big endian)
4+|????
4+|packet
|===

== Embrace the entropy

* So what are those mysterious four bytes?
* Mapping `libopus` onto disassembly:
+

+
* Final range is "the final state of the codec's entropy coder"
* At last, I can decode the audio!

== Extra challenge

* Device outputs raw opus packets
* Instead of decoding into wav, can I pack them into a valid Ogg container?
* After a tedious fight with documentation, it worked
* Valid Ogg file confirmed by `opustools` and `libogg`

== Device functionality

* Retrieve device credentials (id & secret) from the server
* Report metrics (ssid/battery/firmware version)
* Retrieve MQTT server credentials
* Request verify code for pairing
* AI & Translation audio requests/response playback
* Listening on MQTT topic for commands
** Set language
** Update firmware
