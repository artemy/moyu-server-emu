== Epilogue

* With all this information, it's time to write a server
* Slowly converting mocks into Kotlin + Spring Boot
** This tech stack didn't feel right...

== Rewrite it in Rust ðŸ¦€

[.column]
* Rust has a more convenient API for working with bytes
* Felt "closer" to the spirit of the project
* Libraries used:
** Axum: web framework
** SeaORM: database ORM
** async-openai: OpenAI API
** hound: audio generation
** paho-mqtt: mqtt client
